# [2025-01-03] üêΩ bacon-ls - a lot of new features
It's been a while since I have written here and I am happy to announce a lot of new nice features that I baked in `bacon-ls`.

There features are available with [version 0.8.0](https://crates.io/crates/bacon-ls) of `bacon-ls` and requires `bacon` at
least at [version 3.7.0](https://crates.io/crates/bacon). This new version of `bacon` adds some amazing support at parsing
the JSON that can be produced by `cargo` when running with the option `--message-format json-diagnostic-rendered-ansi`.

Directly parsing this format allows for very precise span locations and direct access to `cargo` and `clippy` suggestions.

## New features 

* **Precise diagnostics positions**: since spans are precisely gathered from `cargo`, now the diagnostics locations are 
  only applied to right portion of text.
* **Code actions**: Replacement and quick fix code actions are now exposed by `bacon-ls` to the LSP client, allowing
  for refactoring similar to the one available on `rust-analyzer`.
* **VsCode extensions**: extensions for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and derivatives are
  now published on the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MatteoBigoi.bacon-ls-vscode)
  and on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/MatteoBigoi/bacon-ls-vscode)

**Please take a moment to read `bacon-ls` [README](https://github.com/crisidev/bacon-ls/blob/main/README.md) as the `bacon`
location configuration has changed and must be updated to work properly.**

Happy diagnostics ü¶Ä!

# [2024-05-20] üêΩ bacon-ls - LSP in Rust
What is the experience of building a Language Server in Rust ü¶Ä you ask?
Without any prior knowledge of the protocol?

Well, it not bad.. It requires basic familiarity with the [tokio](https://docs.rs/crate/tokio/) 
asynchronous ecosystem and with Rust async in general, but you can get 
something done in a couple of days of work.

`bacon-ls` depends on [tower-lsp](https://docs.rs/crate/tower-lsp/) for the 
STDIN/STDOUT/HTTP communication and on [tokio](https://docs.rs/crate/tokio/)
for the asynchronous runtime and the foundational LSP types are provided by
[lsp-types](https://docs.rs/crate/lsp-types).

[Bacon](https://dystroy.org/bacon/) writes a file with a diagnostic per line
and `bacon-ls` requires a specific format that can be parsed:

```bash
line_format = "{kind}:{path}:{line}:{column}:{message}{context}"
```

Since [Bacon](https://dystroy.org/bacon/) supports (from [#5d95852](https://github.com/Canop/bacon/commit/5d958528a19cb3ec3b8129df7f0364bb0716932c)) 
the message `{context}`, any other line captured in relation to the current 
diagnostic, `bacon-ls` can emit the whole diagnostic, including hints from
clippy and cargo.

## Diagnostics and Language Servers
Language clients can request [textDocument/diagnostic](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_diagnostic) and [workspace/diagnostic](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#workspace_diagnostic) capabilities, expecting the list of diagnostics for the current
file or for the whole workspace. The diagnostic carries metadata, such has
the `line:column` of the diagnostic, URL, message and so on..

I think you see where this is going..

`bacon-ls` reads [Bacon](https://dystroy.org/bacon/) diagnostics and exposes
them on the LSP interface to clients requesting it üöÄ!

## Some some Rust please

`tower-lsp` is implemented more or less how you would expect it. It exports a 
[LanguageServer](https://docs.rs/tower-lsp/latest/tower_lsp/trait.LanguageServer.html)
trait the user can implement to expose the capabilities for their use-case.

For `bacon-ls`, we only need to implement 3 methods:

- Initialize the LSP server
- Implement [textDocument/diagnostic](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_diagnostic)
- Implement [workspace/diagnostic](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#workspace_diagnostic)
### Initialize the LSP server

The LSP server must be initialized so that it can returns the list of available
capabilities to clients.

[![initialize](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-20/initialize.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-20/initialize.png)

### Fetch diagnostic from Bacon

All the rest of the LSP server implementation is using this function to fetch them
diagnostics from Bacon. 

[![bacon-diagnostic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-20/bacon-diagnostic.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-20/bacon-diagnostic.png)

### Implement textDocument/diagnostic

This method is what is being called by the LSP client when it wants to retrieve the current
document diagnostic.

[![document-diagnostic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-20/document-diagnostic.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-20/document-diagnostic.png)

### Implement workspace/diagnostic


This method is what is being called by the LSP client when it wants to retrieve the whole
workspace diagnostic.

[![workspace-diagnostic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-20/workspace-diagnostic.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-20/workspace-diagnostic.png)

### Tower service

The LSP server is implemented as a [Tower](https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/) service and only requires a structure implementing the [LanguageServer](https://docs.rs/tower-lsp/latest/tower_lsp/trait.LanguageServer.html). Tower will take care of the LSP server process lifecycle, clients handling and so on.

## Done üöÄ

I was not expecting this do be so easy and well integrated with Rust!
# [2024-05-18] üåé Uploading blog programmatically

I am a lazy person spending most of their time in a terminal üíª...

This is one of the reasons why [lmno.lol](https://lmno.lol) really suites me.. I update my 
markdown locally, drag it on the edit page, click save, boom, done üëà!

Since I don't want to move out of my terminal, I hacked a little script
using [curl](https://curl.se/) to upload my blog programmatically.

[lmno.lol](https://lmno.lol) is protected by a cookie based authentication
system. The first thing to do is to login with the username and password.
Luckily the login screen is a form I can submit with curl with roughly this
command:

[![login curl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-18/login-curl.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-18/login-curl.png)

After storing the cookie session key, we can now move to the next step, which
is uploading a new version of [lmno.lol/crisidev](https://lmno.lol/crisidev)! 

## Today I learned something wild!
I was inspecting the Firefox console during the blog upload phase, after clicking `save` on
`https://lmno.lol/crisidev/edit` and I found the API POST call to `https://lmno.lol/api`
that is responsible to update my blog.

I click on the request and üî•

[![copy as curl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-18/copy-as-curl.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-18/copy-as-curl.png)

I am crying of joy.

## Update my blog

Mozilla produces a working `curl` command that I had to tweak a little to basically this:

[![api curl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-18/api-curl.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-18/api-curl.png)

Easy! 
## The result

[![script result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-18/script-result.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-18/script-result.png)

## Auto publish anyone? ü§©

The blog is a self-contained [Github repo](https://github.com/crisidev/blog) and is published
to [lmno.lol/crisidev](https://lmno.lol/crisidev) using a 
[Github action](https://github.com/crisidev/blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml)
based on the learnings above so that every time I update it the repository and push on `main`, 
the CI kicks in and a new version is published automatically üöÄ

## The code
Here is the full script, which is shared also as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/crisidev/658906ccd133ddb0083258771ffe17e9).

# [2024-05-17] üêΩ Bacon Language Server
If you, like, me, spend a lot of my development time doing Rust ü¶Ä inside Neovim and is not 
satisfied by [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) performance with medium to 
large sized repositories, you are in the right place ü§©.

Disabling `rust-analyzer.diagnostic` and `rust-analyzer.checkOnSave`, the experience becomes
much more snappy, but we loose LSP diagnostics. Here comes [Bacon](https://dystroy.org/bacon/)
to the rescue.. Bacon is a wrapper around `cargo` that watches the crate we 
are developing, runs the target command (build, test, clippy, etc..) when there are changes
and reports the diagnostics in a structured view in the `bacon` TUI. This little tool is also 
able to keep the `cargo` diagnostics up to date in a file and in a format we can parse.

## üêΩ bacon-ls

[bacon-ls](https://github.com/crisidev/bacon-ls) is the companion to Bacon, reading the diagnostics 
from the Bacon export file and exposing them via the Language Server Protocol over standard input.

### So how does developing with `bacon-ls` looks like?


First of all, `bacon` and `bacon-ls` must be installed on the system:

```bash
‚ùØ‚ùØ‚ùØ cargo install --locked bacon bacon-ls
```

We need to disable a couple of rules in `rust-analyzer` configuration.
Depending on your editor, the instructions could differ, but for Neovim LSP, it is 
roughly like this:

```lua
default_settings = {
    ["rust-analyzer"] = { 
        diagnostics = { enable = false },
        checkOnSave = { enable = false },
    }
}
```

`bacon-ls` needs to be added to the available servers for [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/).
Unfortunately this is still manual, but I am slowly adding the support upstream:

- ‚úÖ [#3160](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/3160) Add `bacon-ls` to nvim-lspconfig 
- üïñ [#5774](https://github.com/mason-org/mason-registry/pull/5774) Add `bacon-ls` to mason-nvim 
- üïñ [#186](https://github.com/Canop/bacon/pull/187)  Include compiler hints in [Bacon](https://dystroy.org/bacon/) locations 
- üïñ [#3132](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/pull/3212) Add `bacon-ls` to LazyVim [Rust extras](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/blob/main/lua/lazyvim/plugins/extras/lang/rust.lua)

```lua
local configs = require("lspconfig.configs")
if not configs.bacon_ls then
    configs.bacon_ls = {
        default_config = {
            cmd = { "bacon-ls" },
            root_dir = require("lspconfig").util.root_pattern(".git"),
            filetypes = { "rust" },
        },
    }
end
lspconfig.bacon_ls.setup({ autostart = true })
```

And now you are ready to go!

Neovim should look like this:

[![neovim bacon img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-17/screenshot.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crisidev/blog/main/posts/2024-05-17/screenshot.png)

If you like the look and feel, you can check my Neovim [configurations](https://github.com/crisidev/lazyvim) 
and this [blog post](https://lmno.lol/crisidev/lunarvim-lazyvim) üòÄ.

### Live diagnostics

With a properly configured client, the experience is pretty snappy. I keep `nvim-lspconfig`
setting `update_in_insert = true` for very smooth diagnostic icons transitions.

If you are interested in how the LSP server is designed and implemented, I'll shortly release 
a new post about it!

`bacon-ls` is open source and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/crisidev/bacon-ls).

# [2024-05-09] üöÄ LunarVim -> LazyVim

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my IDE for a long time, mainly for Rust, Python, C, Go, Lua and the usual markup languages and configuration management such has YAML, JSON, Toml and Mardown.

I all started by porting my incredibly old (10+ years) and complicated Vim configuration to Neovim, all implemented in vimscript. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE üî•..

Later on I discovered you can configure Neovim using Lua and I fell in love with it.

I built a bloated and complex configuration in Lua, based on the [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) distribution and inspired on the great work of [@abzcoding](https://github.com/abzcoding/lvim), piling up to a ton of code and customizations:

```sh
‚ùØ‚ùØ‚ùØ ~/.homesick/repos/lvim/home/.config/lvim $ tokei .
===============================================================================
 Language            Files        Lines         Code     Comments       Blanks
===============================================================================
 JSON                    8          804          804            0            0
 Lua                    76         9900         8668          549          683
 TOML                    2           55           43            0           12
 Vim script             13          425          361           33           31
===============================================================================
 Total                  99        11184         9876          582          726
===============================================================================
```

Unfortunately LunarVim is [not being actively maintained](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim/discussions/4518#discussioncomment-8963843) and I had several issues maintaining such a complex configuration, so I started looking at alternatives and into only implementing configurations and utilities for the functionalities I use daily.

I tried out [Astronvim](https://astronvim.com/), but it uses a lot of plugins I don't like for important functionalities such has UI and buffers.

This Github [issue](https://github.com/abzcoding/lvim/issues/145#issuecomment-2079957357) pointed me at [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) and I fell in üíó again: it is properly maintained by [@folke](https://github.com/folke), the author of many plugins I use and love and after a couple of evenings of work, I was able to port all my configuration to LazyVim and I now have a faster and more consistent experience in multiple languages.

On top of this, it's less code to maintain ü§©. It's still a lot, but what the heck, Neovim is what helps me pay the bills üí∏!

```sh
‚ùØ‚ùØ‚ùØ ~/.config/nvim $ tokei .
===============================================================================
 Language            Files        Lines         Code     Comments       Blanks
===============================================================================

 Lua                    48         3864         3516          136          212
 Markdown                1           24            0           16            8
 TOML                    1            3            3            0            0
===============================================================================
 Total                  57         4783         4411          152          220
